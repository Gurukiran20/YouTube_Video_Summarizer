# YouTube Video Transcriber

This project extracts and compiles transcripts from YouTube videos using the `youtube_transcript_api` library. It fetches subtitles directly from a video, cleans up the text, and displays the full transcript in a readable format. This is especially helpful for summarizing video content, studying lectures, or creating text-based resources from video materials.

## How It Works
1. **Fetch Video ID:** Extracts the unique video ID from the YouTube URL.
2. **Retrieve Transcript:** Uses the YouTube Transcript API to get the video’s subtitles.
3. **Combine and Display:** Joins all subtitle text into a single, readable string and prints the full transcript.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `youtube_transcript_api`

## Future Enhancements
- Add AI-based summarization using OpenAI’s GPT models.
- Implement support for multiple languages.
- Option to save transcripts as text files.

## Conclusion
The YouTube Video Transcriber is a simple yet effective tool for extracting video subtitles and transforming them into easy-to-read text. It saves time and effort by providing direct access to a video’s content without the need to watch it in its entirety. This project lays a strong foundation for future enhancements like AI-driven summarization and multilingual support.
